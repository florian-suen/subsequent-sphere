## The Beginning of the End

Mighty dragons, evil demons, corrupt lords, and even potion sellers that won't sell me his strongest potions! A wild Florian has appeared to bring salvation and maybe some joy to the realm of the living! Hello fellow traveller. You might be asking who I am? There's no need to be so hasty, as time is all we have (until we don't). Please sit back and enjoy your stay, as the tale I'm about to tell will be one for the ages...

## Why am I here?

I decided that since I've always have these thoughts in my head, these strange quirky ideas, it would be a huge shame if they were all lost in the sea of the void. I want to share with you my personal introspections and any wonderful contraptions that could be build by me one day. It will be mundane and utterly fruitless to read in the end, but that is why you're here, to cure your boredom with even more drivel!

## My First Concoction

So to tell you the truth.. I've already begun brewing my greatest work yet. What is it you may ask? It's a video game! I've had this idea of creating my own game for a long time. It stems largely from my younger years. The one thing I enjoyed more than anything is staying at home, curtains down, a packet of crisps ready, and finally booting up the console to dive myself into a world that is fantastical and free from the whims of societal pressure.

I will try my absolute best to detail my process and any bumps and struggles along the way. What comes at the end is unclear, but what is life without uncertainty?

## A Storm is Approaching

Alas, here we stand at our first crossroad. Do you choose to stay and continue, or will our destinies split irrevocably here. The journey has only just begun and every step forward demands sacrifices. But sometimes, just sometimes, dreams are worth dying for.
